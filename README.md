# Wireless-Systems-Course
This repository contains materials and course projects during attending the Wireless-Systems Course where we became familiar with concepts such as outage probability as a critical metric when we are dealing with different hyperparameters and tend to investigate which one has a better result furthermore, we implemented a simplified model of Rayleigh fading Channel and then analyzed its frequency response, became familiar with narrowband wireless channel and then during a power allocation problem tried to use Stochastic Gradient Ascent which was part of our optimization approach for getting involved with the problem and then found the global maximum which helped us to do power allocation as well as it could be. during the whole part of this project, we considered noise and ISI effects.
one more thing I want to mention is the final project which is all about implementing an OFDM system and using different approaches such as Waterfilling,  Diversity, MMSE, ZF, and MRC concepts in detecting process and then analyze which one has better performance, we analyzed the results using Error-Probability figure for each of that.
